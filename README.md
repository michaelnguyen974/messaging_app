# Messaging app

## Instructions 
Creqating a fully functioning messaging app where we can create, read, update and delete messages using Sinatra library with Capybara/Rspec testing. The messaging app will follow the idea of CRUD (which are the four basic functions of persistent storage).

## Part 1
Database creation using PostgresSQL
## Part 2
Setting up configs, Datamapper(ORM), Capybra/Rspec and 
## User stories
```
User sees the home page at the index where it has
A heading
A form
All the messages with a timestamp in reverse chronological order.

```
As a user, 
I want to be able to create a message.
```
As a user, 
I want to be able to view the message on the home page as a clickable link, with the first 20 characters shown.
```
As a User, 
I want to be able to visit a specific note, see it on the page. 
```
As a User, 
I want to be able to see an edit button
which I can click on that shows me a form which I can use to update the text of that message.
once submitted, the app redirects back to the index and shows the updated message text.
```
As a User, 
I want to see a delete button
which I can click on that deletes that message
and then redirects back to the index.
```
